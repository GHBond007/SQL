# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker








In this Project I created for a business owner an employee tracker app.
In it we can organize a plan for a business.
When the command line is opened it will accept a user's input and the app will begin.
The following options are created:view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.
When a user chooses all departments they will be presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.
When a user chooses all roles they are presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.
WHEN I choose to view all employees.
Then they will be presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.
When they choose to view all employees 
Then they will be presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.
When they choose to add a department 
Then they will be prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.
When they chose to add a role
Then they will be prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.
Then they are prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.
When they choose to update an employee role
Then they are prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.
